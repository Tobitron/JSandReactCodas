# JSandReactCodas
A brainstorm of practice projects for JS and React, welcome contributors! The purpose fo these projects are to brush up on Javascript and learn React.js. I'll first write it in JS, and then do a React remix.

Simple clock - detects users location and displays current time centered vertically and horizontally
Simple stopwatch - features you'd expect from a stopwatch. Also centered vertically and horizontally
Copy Cat - User inputs text in a box, it is instantly reproduced somewhere else on the page
Umbrella - Create rain drops and an "umbrella." Basically the rain drops fall down but stop when they hit the umbrella. User can move the umbrella left or right with the keyboard.
Carousel - make a media carousel
